        <h2>Description.</h2>
        <p>Use fresh or leftover white rice for this easy, vegetable-studded fried rice recipe. We fry the grains in batches and season the dish lightly for a perfect texture and flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups cooked white rice</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of vegetable, sesame, or canola oil</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Small onion</li>
            <li>1 Cup frozen or fresh mixed vegetables</li>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If using day-old rice, transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice. </li>
            <li>Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. </li>
            <li>Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together. </li>
            <li>Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate. Serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
